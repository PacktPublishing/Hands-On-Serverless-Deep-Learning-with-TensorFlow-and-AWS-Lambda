"""Utilities for TensorBoard command line program.

This is a lightweight module for bringing up a TensorBoard HTTP server
or emulating the `tensorboard` shell command.

Those wishing to create custom builds of TensorBoard can use this module
by swapping out `tensorboard.main` with the custom definition that
modifies the set of plugins and static assets.

This module does not depend on first-party plugins or the default web
server assets. Those are defined in `tensorboard.default_plugins`.
